# Data-Visualization-Project-3
Group Project 3

The purpose of the project was the extract data from an api or database, transform the data, clean the data, store it, and use the data to create dataframes, graphs, charts, etc. This data would then be presented as graphs and charts on a dashboard created from html, css, javascript, etc. The goal was to extract data from a movie database and report any trends, correlations, or interesting conclusions that could be shown through cleaning data.

The data was extracted from the OMDb database which contains data on Movies from around the world including their BoxOffice Sale, Actors, Directors, Genre, Language, Runtime, Award, Title, Year, Rating, Etc. The source: https://www.omdbapi.com/, gives direction and guidance on their parameters and API extraction.

To interact with the project, obtain the API key from OMDb and enter that key into the .env file. Then please run the movie_data.py, app.py, movie_data_clean_pymongo.ipynb, and the language.ipynb to transform and clean the data we need for the visualizations. Then run the index.html which would run the script.js to display all the graphs, showing our analysis of the data we graphed and charted.

In terms of ethical consideration, the data was provided by OMDb publically as long as you signed up and is provided with the API key to access their API. All the data on the movies is also available to the public. There is also no individual data reported about actors and directors in compliance to data protection laws. The data was used to compare movies based on their already reported information in their respective categories, therefore not misused or misinterpreted. This data was strictly used for data analysis, not for any commercial purposes and the analysis was done strictly based on the data provided. Data was properly extracted through proper channels such as the provided API and stored within secure databases.
