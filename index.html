                <p>This histogram is of the movies produced over the years based on the data from IMDB. It's increased over
                    the years with technology and according to the data, most movies were produced in 2021-2023. This may be because production was slowed around 2019-2020
                    when Covid-19 was introduced to the world. Based on the data, we could interpret that the spike in 2022 was because of delays in production
                    for 2020, which catapulted the numbers for 2022. 2023 and 2024 seem to be going back on track, which is a steady increase of movies throughout the years.

                <p>This line chart shows the average runtime of movies per year. Based on the chart, we can see that movies between
                    1950 and 1960 had the longest average runtime, reaching a peak of 210 minutes a movie on average. That's 3 hours and 30 minutes per movie on average.
                    This dramatically dropped as the years go by, resulting in movies maintaining an average runtime of about 110-130 minutes.

                <p>This scatter plot shows the top 10 movies based on Box Office sales and awards won by the movies. Overall, it seems
                    the high box office sales get numerous amounts of awards with the lowest being 73 awards to Jurassic World. However, according
                    to the data it isn't an absolute correlation as there are movies that do less in box office sales, but accrue a greater amount of awards.
                    From the data, movies with high box office sales get many awards, but it isn't a direct correlation.
